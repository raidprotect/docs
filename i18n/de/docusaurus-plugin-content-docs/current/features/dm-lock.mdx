The **DM Lock** feature of RaidProtect permanently closes access to server-originated direct messages (DMs), surpassing Discord‚Äôs native limitation, which only allows this block for 24 hours via the "Pause¬†DMs" security action.

## üö¶ Use cases and recommendations {#recommendations}

- **Servers exposed to spam or harassment:** DM Lock is especially recommended for public or high-traffic communities where the risk of DM abuse is higher.
- **Temporary events or sensitive periods:** During launches, major announcements, or periods of heavy activity (e.g. contests, promotions), enabling DM¬†Lock helps prevent phishing or scam attempts.
- **Communities with a young audience:** For servers with many minors, restricting DMs can enhance safety and help prevent inappropriate behavior.
- **Continuous protection:** Thanks to automation, there‚Äôs no vulnerability window from forgetting to renew the block manually.

## ‚ùì How DM Lock works {#working}

The RaidProtect bot regularly checks the server‚Äôs DM blocking setting and, if needed, automatically re-enables it to prevent any vulnerability window between manual renewals. This task runs transparently for server admins and members.

It remains possible to send and receive messages with:
- friends
- bots
- staff

:::warning
Discord‚Äôs community features are essential for DM Lock to function properly. [Follow our guide to check if Community is enabled on your server.](../guides/community.md)

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Command /dmlock-info {#info}

The `/dmlock-info` command informs members about the current **DM Lock** status on the server. It displays a clear message indicating whether the restriction is **enabled** or **disabled**, along with an educational explanation of its purpose.

**Goal:**
- Explain why DMs are limited (to combat spam, scams, phishing).
- Reduce confusion and repeated questions from new members.
- Remind members of the conditions for continuing DM conversations (friends, staff, bots, existing contacts).

**Example Display**
<SeparatedBox>
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="enable" label="Enabled" default>

</Tabs>
</SeparatedBox>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Best Practices

- Encourage active members to use `/dmlock-info` to answer new members‚Äô questions.
- Display it regularly or pin it in your welcome channels.
- Combine it with your rules or announcements to reinforce the server‚Äôs anti-spam policy.
