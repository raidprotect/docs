title: Report a violation to Discord
---

Have you encountered a malicious user on Discord? Report them to ensure appropriate action is taken.

On Discord, some users may not have the best intentions. If their behavior is particularly harmful to the community, it’s recommended to **report them to Discord’s Trust & Safety team**. If the violation is confirmed, the user may face penalties ranging from warnings to account termination. 😖  

## 🧐 What Types of Violations Should Be Reported? {#types-of-violations}

Of course, not all types of violations warrant account termination. Punishable behaviors are outlined in **Discord’s [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)** (as well as in the [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), though the latter is more legal jargon than clear instructions). The list of report categories on the submission page is an excellent summary for those reluctant to read everything.

In general, behaviors that are **harmful to the community** (spam, promotion of illegal content, etc.) or cause **serious harm to a user** (doxxing, harassment) should be reported.

For less severe behavior, consider using **bans** (on a server) or [blocking](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217916488-Blocking-Privacy-Settings) (platform-wide). If you’re not a moderator on the server where the incidents occur, report the behavior to the server’s moderation team, as they are obligated to take action.

## 🕵️ Gathering Evidence {#recover-evidences}

To make a report, you’ll need to provide evidence. Note that **screenshots are not valid proof** as they can be easily forged. You must provide a link (or multiple links) to the offending messages.

**These links are easy to obtain.** On a message that corresponds to the violation you want to report, right-click > Copy Message Link (on desktop) or long-press > Share > Copy to Clipboard (on mobile).

## 📪 Reporting the Violation to the Trust & Safety Team {#report-to-tns}

Reporting is quick and straightforward, taking only a few minutes. First, go to the **dedicated form** by visiting **[https://dis.gd/report](https://dis.gd/report)**.

### Submitting the Report to the Trust & Safety Team {#form}

Depending on the type of report, **different details will be required**. Paste the message link(s) you retrieved earlier in the appropriate field (and add others in the description, if necessary). Be sure to be **as thorough as possible** and maintain polite communication. 😇  

### 📨 Discord’s Response {#discord-response}

A few days after submitting your report—usually within a week—you should receive **an email response** from Discord. Note that you won’t be informed about the specific penalties (if any) imposed on the reported user. 😒
