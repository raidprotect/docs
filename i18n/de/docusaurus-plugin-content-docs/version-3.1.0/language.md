RaidProtect allows you to choose the language used by the bot to best suit your Discord community.

:::note
If your server is set as a community server (Discord setting), RaidProtect will by default use the language configured in the server's **community settings**.
:::

**Public Messages:** The configured language only affects public messages sent by RaidProtect in your server (logs, captcha messages, reports, etc.).

**Ephemeral Messages:** These private or temporary messages remain displayed in the language of the user interacting with the bot.
