Since its creation in 2018 by [Baptiste](https://baptiste.lol/), RaidProtect has become one of the essential French-speaking bots for Discord server security. After more than four years of development and evolution, the project is now undergoing a major transition: **RaidProtect is being taken over by the team behind [S*l*ash FR](https://slash.fr.community/) and [DFR.gg](https://dfr.gg/)**. This takeover aims to secure the bot‚Äôs future, offer new perspectives, and enrich its development.

<!--truncate-->

## Why this takeover? {#why}

Over time, maintaining a bot like RaidProtect became increasingly complicated. Between Discord‚Äôs changes, API updates, and growing demands, it was becoming harder and harder for Baptiste to keep RaidProtect up to date while ensuring its stability and effectiveness. Rather than let RaidProtect shut down, he chose to entrust the project to us.

Our team has taken over, bringing the resources and expertise needed to meet the technical and organizational challenges of RaidProtect. Our goal is simple: to improve and modernize the bot while staying true to what it has always been.

## What‚Äôs changing (and what‚Äôs not!) {#changing}

#### ‚úÖ RaidProtect is still the same bot you know {#same}
The features you rely on aren‚Äôt going anywhere. We‚Äôre keeping **the same philosophy**, and we just want to make it better without disrupting your habits. Security and reliability remain at the heart of the project.

#### üîÑ A technical overhaul for better performance {#technical-overhaul}
The bot has been completely rewritten to be faster, more stable, and better suited to Discord‚Äôs changes. This overhaul wasn‚Äôt just an improvement ‚Äî it was a necessity: with the new version of Discord‚Äôs API, the old version of the bot simply would no longer function. This update also makes it easier for us to add new features.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Updates and new features coming soon {#updates}
One of the major benefits of this takeover is that we can finally invest time and resources into making RaidProtect even more effective. Here are some of the upcoming improvements:
- Support for **slash commands** to align with Discord‚Äôs current standards.
- More **configuration options** to fit each server‚Äôs needs.
- A **multilingual system** to broaden RaidProtect‚Äôs reach.

#### üîê A stronger commitment to security {#safety}
RaidProtect was designed to protect servers, and that remains our top priority. We will closely monitor Discord‚Äôs evolution and adapt the bot to the new tools the platform provides.

## Your questions, our answers (FAQ) {#faq}

When we announced the takeover of RaidProtect, we received many questions from the community. Whether on the support server or during our transition event, we saw strong interest in the bot‚Äôs future. To clarify things and provide clear answers, we‚Äôve gathered the most frequently asked questions here.

#### Who are you and why you? {#faq-1}

More than just a team, we‚Äôre a group of friends who have been combining passion and expertise to build online communities since 2017. We also launched S*l*ash FR, a French-speaking community focused on Discord and its best practices. RaidProtect naturally fits into this ecosystem.

We understand that the idea of a company behind the project may worry some people. To be honest, yes, we will have to fund RaidProtect, because running a bot at this scale is expensive. But we don‚Äôt want to limit the bot or turn everything into paid features. All current features will remain free, and premium options will be available for those who want advanced tools.

#### Why is your agency taking over RaidProtect? {#faq-2}
Our agency specializes in managing Discord servers and developing bots. The team wanted to invest in a major project, and RaidProtect perfectly matched that ambition.

#### What‚Äôs the link with S*l*ash FR? {#faq-3}
S*l*ash FR is a community we created to bring together Discord enthusiasts. RaidProtect naturally fits in, but it remains an independent project.

#### Will the current RaidProtect team change? {#faq-4}
No, most of the community team is continuing the journey, supported by new members from S*l*ash FR. Baptiste himself will still provide occasional support on the project.

#### Will the bot become paid? {#faq-5}
All current features will **remain free**. However, some new advanced features may be offered through a premium subscription to cover maintenance and development costs.

#### Will the design and branding of RaidProtect change? {#faq-6}
No, RaidProtect‚Äôs visual identity will **stay the same**. However, the website will be updated to better reflect the project‚Äôs evolution.

#### Will your team develop other bots? {#faq-7}
The acquisition of RaidProtect is part of a broader plan to eventually offer other tools for Discord servers. However, the current priority is to optimize and perfect RaidProtect.

RaidProtect is evolving, but the spirit remains the same. We know how important this bot is for many servers, and we want to make it an even more reliable, powerful, and adaptable tool for your needs.

Thank you all for your trust ‚Äî the adventure is just beginning! üöÄ
