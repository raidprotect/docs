## 🛡️ No more private message scams! {#new}

Protect your members by automatically blocking the receipt of private messages with [DM Lock](/features/dm-lock). Typical use cases:

- Automated spam waves during events (launches, giveaways, high-traffic periods).
- Scam attempts targeting members, especially on large public servers.
- Inappropriate behavior toward minors or sensitive communities.
- Coordinated attacks during major events (raids, phishing campaigns).

All fully automated, with no risk of forgetting manual steps, ensuring continuous protection for your server.
