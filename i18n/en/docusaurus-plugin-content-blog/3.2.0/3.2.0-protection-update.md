## 🛡️ No more private message scams! {#new}

Protect your members by automatically blocking unsolicited private messages. Typical use cases:

- Waves of automated spam during events (launches, giveaways, peak periods).
- Scam attempts targeting members, especially on large public servers.
- Inappropriate behavior toward minors or sensitive communities.
- Coordinated attacks during major events (raids, phishing campaigns).

All of this is automated, eliminating manual oversights and ensuring continuous protection for your server.

## ✨ Other new features in 3.2.0 {#changelog}

- **Anti-spam penalty options**: Precisely define how RaidProtect responds to different types of spam (kick, ban, etc.) for moderation perfectly tailored to your community.
- **New anti-spam logs**: Greater visibility into what is detected and when, so you stay in control at a glance.
- **Minimum account age without captcha**: Directly filter out brand-new accounts even if captcha is not enabled.
- **`/bypass minage` command**: Manually admit a member who doesn’t meet the account age requirement, handy for exceptions.
