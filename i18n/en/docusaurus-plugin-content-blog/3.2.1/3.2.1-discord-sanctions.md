Version **3.2.1** of RaidProtect focuses on **everyday moderation** with new useful commands and an even more robust anti-spam system.

<!--truncate-->

## ⚖️ View sanctions issued by Discord {#new}

The big new feature of this update: the [`/ds`](/features/utilities#discord-sanctions) command. It allows you to directly view the **official sanctions issued by Discord** against a user.

### 📋 What you can see

- **Type of sanction**: content removed, account restricted, suspended, or deleted.  
- **Date issued** and **type of content** concerned.  
- **Associated flags**: for example, illegal content or automated detection. 

---

## 🛡️ A smarter anti-spam system {#antispam}

The anti-spam system benefits from two major improvements:

- Blocking **Slash Command spam**, often used to disrupt channels.
- New dedicated trigger: [**external command spam**](/features/anti-spam#triggers).

These additions help anticipate new forms of abuse and ensure a smoother experience for your members.

## ⚙️ More tools for your moderators {#changelog}

This update introduces several highly requested commands to make moderation teams’ work easier:

- **[`/slowmode`](/features/moderation#slowmode)**: enable or adjust a channel’s slow mode more precisely in one step.
- **[`/unban`](/features/moderation#unban)**: unban a user faster, with a specified reason.
- **[`/bypass captcha`](/features/captcha#bypass)**: manually allow a legitimate user who fails the captcha.

Additionally, the [`/lock`](/features/channel-lock#lock) and [`/unlock`](/features/channel-lock#unlock) commands can now include a **reason**, improving clarity and moderation tracking.
