## 📋 A Complete Record for Every Sanction {#new}

Keep track of every moderation action with the new [Sanctions History](/features/sanctions). Never wonder again who was sanctioned, when, or why:

- **Automatic centralization**: Bans, kicks, timeouts, and automod sanctions are recorded automatically.
- **Advanced search** with [`/sanctions search`](/features/sanctions#search): Instantly retrieve a member’s history.
- **Full details** with [`/sanctions info`](/features/sanctions#info): View all information on a specific sanction.
- **Flexible editing** with [`/sanctions edit`](/features/sanctions#edit): Correct a reason or adjust an existing sanction.
- **Deletion or reversal** with [`/sanctions delete`](/features/sanctions#delete): Undo a sanction or remove it from history if needed.
- **[Smart sanction status management](/features/sanctions#status)**

Every sanction now generates a confirmation indicating whether the member received the notification via DM.

## ⚡ New Moderation Tools {#moderation}

This update also expands your moderation toolkit with three essential new commands:

- **[`/tempban`](/features/moderation#tempban)**: Temporarily ban a member for a set duration.
- **[`/warn`](/features/moderation#warn)**: Warn a member with full traceability in the history.
- **[`/untimeout`](/features/moderation#untimeout)**: Remove a timeout before it expires.

## 🛡️ Improved RaidMode and JoinLock {#raid}

The anti-raid system is now smarter and more flexible:

- **Automatic deactivation**: [RaidMode](/features/raid-mode#raid-mode) and [Auto RaidMode](/features/raid-mode#duration) turn off automatically after a set time – no more forgotten settings!
- **Duration setting**: Set the duration directly when activating with [`/raidmode`](/features/raid-mode#raid-mode).
- **New [`/joinlock`](/features/join-lock) command**: Close invites indefinitely for full control over new arrivals.
- **Acknowledgment for [Minimum Age](/features/raid-mode#minage)**: Receive confirmation that the member received the explanatory message.

---

## ✨ Other 3.3.0 Updates {#changelog}

- **Dedicated sanction logs**: Set up a channel to centralize all sanction logs.
- **[`/channel duplicate`](/features/utilities#channel-duplicate)**: Strictly duplicate a channel with all its settings.
- **`/changelog` command**: View the changelog directly in Discord, also accessible via `/settings` and `/about`.
