## 🔒 New "Jail" Sanction {#jail}

Isolate a disruptive member without banning them with the new [Jail "Prison"](/features/sanctions#jail) system. The member is confined to a dedicated channel, with no access to the rest of the server:

- **[`/jail`](/features/moderation#jail)**: Jail a member immediately.
- **[`/tempjail`](/features/moderation#tempjail)**: Temporarily jail a member for a set duration.
- **[`/unjail`](/features/moderation#unjail)**: Release a member at any time.
- **Flexible configuration**: Set the Jail role and information channel directly via `/settings`.

Jail lets you handle sensitive situations while still being able to communicate with the member before making a final decision.

## 🔇 Role-based Mute: Beyond Discord Timeout {#mute}

Discord timeout is convenient, but restrictive: it **blocks all interactions** for the member, including buttons and menus. A timed-out member cannot view their sanctions, open a ticket, or interact with anything on the server. And its duration is limited to 28 days.

The new [Role-based Mute](/features/sanctions#mute) solves these issues:

- Beyond a [configurable threshold](/features/sanctions#mute-threshold), the bot automatically assigns a **Mute role** instead of Discord timeout. The member can no longer write, but retains the ability to use buttons and menus.
- The `/timeout` and `/untimeout` commands become [`/mute`](/features/moderation#timeout) and [`/unmute`](/features/moderation#untimeout) with smart behavior: **below the threshold, classic Discord timeout is used**.
- New `[force_timeout]` parameter to force Discord timeout regardless of the duration.

## ⚡ Enhanced Moderation {#moderation}

This update brings new tools for your moderators and members:

- **[Context menu](/features/moderation#context-menu)**: Sanction a member with a simple right-click on their profile, no command needed.
- **[`/my-sanctions`](/features/utilities#my-sanctions)**: Allow your members to view their own sanctions, with a [privacy setting](/features/sanctions#sanctions-privacy) to control access.
- **[Media display](/features/sanctions#show-medias)** in sanction reasons: visual evidence is directly visible.
- **Filter redesign** in [`/sanctions search`](/features/sanctions#search) with a new [moderator type](/features/sanctions#search) filter.
- **[Import / Export](/features/sanctions#import-export)** sanctions via the support bot.
