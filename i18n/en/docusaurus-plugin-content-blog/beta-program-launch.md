We have great news for the RaidProtect community: **the BETA program is officially live**! 🎉

We now want to take our quality approach even further by involving you directly. This program gives you early access to upcoming bot features… while helping us test them before public release.

## Why a beta program? {#why-beta}

Developing a bot like RaidProtect involves many tests, adjustments, and checks. By opening this beta program, we have two main goals:

- **Test new features in real-world conditions**.
- **Get direct feedback** from the community to continually improve the user experience.

And the best part? **Premium features** are included for free on selected servers during the testing phase. 😍

## What’s included right now? {#features-beta}

The beta program gives you early access to several new features already available in the test version:

- 🧵 **Slash commands & button interactions**: for a modernized user experience.
- 🌍 **Internationalization**: the bot now speaks both French *and* English.
- 📢 **New `/report` command**: easily report problematic behavior.
- 🛡️ **Ignore roles or users in antispam**: for more flexibility.
- 🔒 **Option to rename channels via `/lock`**: customize your security.
- 🔧 **Stability improvements**: fewer bugs, more reliability.

These features will be rolled out publicly after being validated by beta testers.

## Who can participate? {#who}

Anyone can apply, as long as you manage an active Discord server and are willing to test new features. A few prerequisites:

- **Regular activity** is required.
- You must keep **your DMs open** so we can contact you.
- In case of prolonged inactivity, we may revoke your beta access.

## How to join the program? {#how}

It couldn’t be easier: fill out our application form (it takes less than 5 minutes) at this link:
