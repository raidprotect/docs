RaidProtect's Anti-spam is a powerful tool to prevent spam on your Discord server. Thanks to its automatic detection system, it handles issues on its own without requiring your intervention.

## ‚ùì How the Anti-spam Works {#working}

RaidProtect's anti-spam detects and automatically blocks suspicious behavior. It distinguishes between two types of spam.
- **Heavy spam:** Messages containing invitation links, mass mentions, or images. This type of spam is often used during raids.
- **Light spam:** Messages sent frequently but less intrusive.

RaidProtect's anti-spam acts in two ways.
- **Sanctions:** Automatic kicking or banning of spammers.
- **Notifications:** Sends messages to the log channel to report blocked spam with an overview of detected actions.

## üõ°Ô∏è Configuring the Anti-spam {#config}

RaidProtect offers three security levels to meet your server's needs.
- üî¥ **High:** Sanctions all spam, including heavy spam in ignored channels.
- üü† **Medium:** Sanctions all spam but respects ignored channels.
- üü¢ **Low:** Sanctions only heavy spam.

### Changing the Security Level {#level}

1. Use the [`/settings` command](../setup.md#settings).
2. Click on the ‚Äú**Anti-spam**‚Äù button.
3. Select the desired anti-spam level from the first dropdown.

### Managing Ignored Roles, Users, and Channels {#ignore}

You can exclude certain channels, roles, or even users from anti-spam monitoring for added flexibility. üòâ
1. Use the [`/settings` command](../setup.md#settings).
2. Click on the ‚Äú**Anti-spam**‚Äù button.
3. Select the different options to ignore in the dropdowns:
- Channel(s) to ignore
- Role(s) to ignore
- Member(s) to ignore

:::info
Channels containing ‚Äú**spam**‚Äù in their name are automatically ignored. Users with administrator permissions are completely ignored.

### Configure Sanctions by Trigger {#triggers}

You can customize the sanctions applied depending on the type of spam detected. This allows for a response adapted to the severity of the violation.

1. Use the [ `/settings` command](../setup.md#settings).
2. Click on the ‚Äú**Anti-spam**‚Äù button.
3. Go to the ‚Äú**Sanctions**‚Äù tab.
4. For each trigger, select a specific sanction. You can modify these values using the dropdown menus:
- **Select a trigger**: choose the type of spam to configure.
- **Select a sanction**: choose the corresponding sanction.

#### Types of Sanctions and Triggers {#sanctions}

Here are the different **available sanctions** as well as the **triggers** that RaidProtect can detect, along with the **default timeout duration** if applicable:

- **Warn**: Sends a warning to the member.
- **Kick**: Removes the member from the server.
- **Timeout**: Mutes the member for a set duration.
- **Softban**: Bans and immediately unbans the member, deleting their messages.
- **Ban**: Permanently bans the member.
