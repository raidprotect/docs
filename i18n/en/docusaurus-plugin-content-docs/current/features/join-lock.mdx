The **Join Lock** feature of RaidProtect permanently closes access to new members joining the server, surpassing Discord's native limitation, which only allows this block for 24 hours via the "Pause Invites" security action.

## 🚦 Use cases and recommendations {#recommendations}

- **Private and closed servers:** Join Lock is especially recommended for servers that need to remain private and don't want any new arrivals (corporate servers, restricted teams, private groups).
- **Staff servers:** For servers dedicated to moderation or administration teams, where only authorized members should have access.
- **Corporate or professional servers:** For organizations using Discord internally and wanting to ensure only current employees can access the server.
- **Limited-size communities:** For servers that have reached their desired maximum size and don't want to accept new members permanently.

## ❓ How Join Lock works {#working}

RaidProtect permanently closes joins on your server. Unlike Discord's native feature which requires manual renewal every 24 hours, this method allows permanent blocking without intervention.

:::info
Members already present on the server remain active and can continue to use the server normally.

:::warning
Discord's community features are essential for Join Lock to function properly. [Follow our guide to check if Community is enabled on your server.](../guides/community.md)
