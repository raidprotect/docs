RaidProtect's **Join Lock** feature allows you to permanently close access to new arrivals on the server, thus surpassing Discord's native limitation which only allows this blocking for 24 hours via the safety action "Pause joins".

## 🚦 Use cases and recommendations {#recommendations}

- **Private and closed servers:** Join Lock is particularly recommended for servers that need to remain private and do not want any new arrivals (company servers, restricted teams, private groups).
- **Staff servers:** For servers dedicated to the moderation or administration team, where only authorized members should have access.
- **Corporate or professional servers:** For organizations that use Discord internally and want to ensure that only current employees can access the server.
- **Limited-size communities:** For servers that have reached their desired maximum size and no longer want to accept new members permanently.

## ❓ How Join Lock works {#working}

RaidProtect permanently closes joins on your server. Unlike Discord's native feature which requires manual renewal every 24 hours, this method allows permanent blocking without intervention.

:::info
Members already present on the server remain active and can continue to use the server normally.

:::warning
Discord's community features are essential for Join Lock to work properly. [Follow our guide to verify that community is enabled on your server.](../guides/community.md)
