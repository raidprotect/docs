title: Sanctions History

import Icon from "@site/src/components/Icon";

RaidProtect's sanctions history allows you to track and manage all sanctions applied on your server. This system centralizes all moderation actions in a searchable and editable database, making it easier for your moderation team to work.

## ❓ How the history works {#working}

The sanctions history automatically records all moderation actions performed on your server:

- **Manual sanctions**: All moderation commands (`/ban`, `/tempban`, `/kick`, `/timeout`, `/warn`) are automatically recorded in the history.
- **Automatic sanctions**: Sanctions applied by anti-spam are also added to the sanctions history.
- **Bans, kicks and timeouts**: Sanctions applied without using RaidProtect are added to the history.
- **Discord's Automod**: Sanctions applied by Discord's automod are also added.
- **Sanction notifications**: Sanctioned members receive a private message informing them of the sanction and its reason. The bot also sends an acknowledgment receipt confirming the sending of this notification.

:::info
All recorded sanctions contain: the sanctioned user, the responsible moderator, the reason (up to 512 characters), the date and time, as well as the type of sanction and whether the user was notified.

## 🔍 Search for sanctions {#search}

The `/sanctions search` command allows you to search for sanctions in the history according to different criteria.

Use the command: ```/sanctions search [user] [moderator] [type] [date] [status]```

- `[user]`: Search for all sanctions of a specific user.
- `[moderator]`: Search for all sanctions applied by a specific moderator.
- `[type]`: Filter by sanction type (Ban, Softban, Unban, Kick, Timeout, Untimeout, Warn).
- `[date]`: Filter by sanction date.
- `[status]`: Filter by sanction status (Active, Expired, Canceled).

:::tip
You can combine multiple criteria to refine your search. For example, search for all bans performed by a specific moderator.

## ℹ️ View a sanction {#info}

The `/sanctions info` command allows you to get detailed information about a specific sanction.

Use the command: ```/sanctions info (id)```

Replace `(id)` with the identifier of the sanction you want to view.

## ✏️ Edit a sanction {#edit}

The `/sanctions edit` command allows you to modify the reason of an existing sanction, useful for correcting an error or adding details.

Use the command: ```/sanctions edit (id) (new_reason)```

Replace `(id)` with the identifier of the sanction to modify and `(new_reason)` with the new reason (maximum 512 characters).

:::warning
Editing a sanction updates the record in the history but does not change the sanction applied on Discord (for example, a banned user will remain banned).
:::

## 🗑️ Delete a sanction {#delete}

The `/sanctions delete` command allows you to delete a sanction from the history. This action is irreversible.

Use the command: ```/sanctions delete (id)```

Replace `(id)` with the identifier of the sanction to delete.

## Sanction status {#status}

Sanctions can have different statuses :

| **Status**    | **Emojis**                                                                                                                  | **Meanings**                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Active`      |                                                                                                                             | The sanction is in progress.                              |
| `Expired`     | <Icon src="/img/icons/SanctionStatusEXPIRED.svg" alt="icon SanctionStatusEXPIRED" title=":iconSanctionStatusEXPIRED:"/>     | The sanction has expired.                                 |
| `Canceled`    | <Icon src="/img/icons/SanctionStatusCANCELED.svg" alt="icon SanctionStatusCANCELED" title=":iconSanctionStatusCANCELED:"/>  | The sanction has been canceled by a moderator.            |
| `Failed`      | <Icon src="/img/icons/SanctionStatusFAILED.svg" alt="icon SanctionStatusFAILED" title=":iconSanctionStatusFAILED:"/>        | The sanction has failed (missing permissions).            |

### Handling duplicates {#duplicates}

When an active and previous sanction is found, you can :

- **Merge** the two sanctions : the durations will be added if possible and the reasons will be concatenated.
- **Cancel** the active sanction and create a new sanction.
- **Overwrite** the active sanction with the information of the sanction typed.

## 📊 Sanctions logs {#logs}

For better organization, you can configure a log channel dedicated specifically to sanctions, separate from your general logs.
