title: Tag Role
---

The Tag Role automatically assigns a role to members who add your server’s tag to their Discord profile. By assigning a role to these members, you acknowledge their commitment and encourage them to actively represent your server. It’s a simple yet effective way to strengthen collective identity while rewarding your community’s most loyal ambassadors.

## ❓ How the Tag Role Works {#working}

It’s simple. As soon as a member adds the server’s tag to their Discord profile, RaidProtect automatically assigns them a specific role.  
If the member removes the tag, the role is removed.

:::info
If the Tag is not enabled or your server doesn’t yet have the feature, the Tag Role will have no effect.

## 🎖️ Configuring the Tag Role {#config}

Configuration takes just a few clicks:  
1. Use the [command `/settings`](../setup.md#settings).  
2. Click the “**Tag Role**” button.  
3. Select an existing role via the selector or click “**Create one for me**”.  
4. You can deselect the role at any time by clicking on the “**Reset**” button.

:::tip
Members will receive the role the next time they update their profile (Username, Avatar, Banner, Roles, Tag…). You can [contact support](https://raidprotect.bot/discord) to request a full role sync if you have many members who currently have or previously had the Tag.
