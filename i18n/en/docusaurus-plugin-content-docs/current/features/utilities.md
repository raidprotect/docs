Additional features to simplify the management of your server. ðŸ”§

In addition to core features like the captcha system and anti-raid protection, RaidProtect offers several secondary tools that can make managing your server even smoother.

## ðŸ‘¤ User Information {#userinfo}

The command `/userinfo` allows you to obtain detailed information about a user, such as their **Discord account creation date** and the **date they joined** your server (if they are a member).

Use the command: ```/userinfo [@user]```

Replace `[@user]` with the desired mention or ID.

## ðŸ§¹ Clear a Group of Messages {#clear}

The command `/clear` allows you to quickly delete a certain number of messages in a text channel. You can specify a user to delete only their messages.

Use the command: ```/clear [number] (@user)```

- Replace `[number]` with the number of messages you wish to delete (maximum 100).
- Add `(@user)` using the mention or ID to target only their messages in the channel.
