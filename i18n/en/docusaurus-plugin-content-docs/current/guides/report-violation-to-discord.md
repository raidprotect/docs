title: Report a violation to Discord
---

Have you encountered a malicious user on Discord? Report them so that they can be sanctioned.

On Discord, some users may not have good intentions. If they display behavior that is particularly harmful to the community, it is advisable to **report it to Discord's Trust & Safety team**. If the violation is found to be valid, the user may face sanctions ranging from a warning to account deletion. 😖 

## 🧐 What Types of Violations to Report? {#types-of-violations}

Of course, not all types of violations are subject to account deletion. Punishable behaviors are described in **Discord's [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)** (as well as in the [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), which is more legal jargon than clear instructions). The list of report types on the reporting page is a great summary for those hesitant to read extensively.

In general, **harmful behaviors to the community** (spam, promotion of illegal content, etc.) or **serious harm to a user** (doxxing, harassment) should be reported.

For less extreme behaviors, **prefer banning** (on a server) or [blocking](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/217916488-Blocking-and-Privacy-Settings) (throughout Discord). If you are not a moderator on the server where the actions are happening, feel free to report it to the moderation team, who must take action.

## 🕵️ Collecting Evidence {#recover-evidences}

To make a report, you need to provide evidence. First, note that **screenshots are not useful**; they can be easily falsified. You will need at least one (or preferably several) message links.

**These links are very easy to obtain**. On a message corresponding to the violation you wish to report, right-click > Copy Message Link (on desktop) or Long press > Share > Copy to Clipboard (on mobile).

## 📪 Reporting the Violation to the _Trust & Safety_ Team {#report-to-tns}

Filing a report is very easy and takes only a few minutes. First, go to the **dedicated form** by following the link **https://dis.gd/report**.

Depending on the type of report selected, **different information will be requested**. Enter the link to the message obtained in the previous step in the appropriate field (and possibly the others in the description). Don’t hesitate to be **as thorough as possible** and remember the basic rules of politeness. 😇 

### 📨 Discord's Response {#discord-response}

A few days after your report—generally within a week—you should receive **a response via email** from Discord. Note that you will not be able to know the sanctions taken (or not) against the reported user. 😒
