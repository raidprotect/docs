title: Report a Violation to Discord
---
Have you encountered a malicious user on Discord? Report them so they can be sanctioned.

On Discord, some users don't always have good intentions. If they exhibit behavior that is particularly harmful to the community, it is recommended to **report them to Discord's Trust & Safety team**. If the violation is verified, the user may face sanctions ranging from a warning to account deletion.

## What types of violations should be reported? {#types-of-violations}

Obviously, not all types of violations are grounds for account deletion. Punishable behaviors are described in **Discord's [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)** (as well as in the [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), but those are more legal jargon than clear guidelines). The list of report types on the reporting page is a very good summary for those reluctant to read.

As a general rule, behaviors that are **harmful to the community** (spam, promotion of illegal content, etc.) or that constitute **serious harm to a user** (doxxing, harassment) should be reported.

For less extreme behaviors, **prefer banning** (on a server) or [blocking](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/fr/articles/217916488-Blocage-et-param%C3%A8tres-de-confidentialit%C3%A9) (across all of Discord). If you are not a moderator on the server where the acts are taking place, don't hesitate to report it to the moderation team of that server, who should take action.

## Gathering evidence {#recover-evidences}

To file a report, you need evidence to provide. First of all, note that **screenshots are useless**, as they are very easily falsifiable. You will absolutely need one (or more, which is even better) message links.

**These links are very easy to obtain**. On a message corresponding to the violation you want to report, right-click > Copy Message Link (on desktop) or Long Press > Share > Copy to clipboard (on mobile).

## Report the violation to the _Trust & Safety_ team {#report-to-tns}

Filing a report is very easy and only takes a few minutes. First, go to the **dedicated form** by following the link **https://dis.gd/report**.

Depending on the type of report chosen, **different information will be requested**. Enter the message link obtained in the previous step in the appropriate field (and optionally others in the description). Don't hesitate to be **as thorough as possible** and don't forget basic courtesy rules.

### Discord's response {#discord-response}

A few days after your report - usually within a week - you should receive **an email response** from Discord. Note that you will not be able to know what sanctions (if any) were taken against the reported user.
