### Requirements {#requirement}

To ensure the proper functioning of RaidProtect:
1. **Grant the Administrator permission** to RaidProtect. This allows it to automatically moderate all your channels.
2. **Place its role at the same level as your server administrators**. The permission system does not allow RaidProtect to sanction users with a role above it.

### Installation {#install}

Once RaidProtect is added to your server, run the [`/setup`](./setup.md#install) command.

<DocCard item={{ type: 'link', href: '/setup', docId: 'setup', label: 'Guided Installation' }} />

:::note
For the less adventurous (or the more impatient), you can simply read the instructions of the [`/setup`](./setup.md#advanced) command which summarizes the main information of each feature.
