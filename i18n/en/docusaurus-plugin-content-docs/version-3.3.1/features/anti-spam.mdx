RaidProtect's Anti-spam is a powerful tool to prevent spam on your Discord server. Thanks to its automatic detection system, it handles problems on its own, without requiring your intervention.

## ❓ How anti-spam works {#working}

RaidProtect's anti-spam automatically detects and blocks suspicious behavior. It distinguishes between two types of spam.
- **Heavy spam:** Messages containing invitation links, mass mentions, or images. These spams are often used during raids.
- **Light spam:** Messages sent frequently but less intrusive.

RaidProtect's anti-spam acts in two ways.
- **Sanctions:** Automatic kick or ban of spammers.
- **Notifications:** Sending messages to the logs channel to report blocked spam with a preview of detected actions.

## 🛡️ Anti-spam configuration {#config}

RaidProtect offers three security levels to meet your server's needs.
- 🔴 **High:** Sanctions all spam and even heavy spam in ignored channels.
- 🟠 **Medium:** Sanctions all spam, but respects ignored channels.
- 🟢 **Low:** Sanctions only heavy spam.

### Change the security level {#level}

1. Run the [`/settings` command](../setup.md#settings).
2. Click the "**Anti-spam**" button.
3. Select the desired anti-spam level in the first selector.

### Manage ignored roles, users, and channels {#ignore}

You can exclude certain channels, roles, or even users from anti-spam monitoring for more flexibility. 😉
1. Run the [`/settings` command](../setup.md#settings).
2. Click the "**Anti-spam**" button.
3. Select the different options to ignore in the various selectors:
- Channel(s) to ignore
- Role(s) to ignore
- Member(s) to ignore

:::info
Channels containing "**spam**" in their name are automatically ignored. Users with administrator permission are completely ignored.

### Configure sanctions by trigger {#triggers}

You can customize the sanctions applied based on the type of spam detected. This allows a response adapted to the severity of the offense.

1. Run the [`/settings` command](../setup.md#settings).
2. Click the "**Anti-spam**" button.
3. Go to the "**Sanctions**" tab.
4. For each trigger, select a specific sanction. You can modify these values using the dropdown menus:
- **Select a trigger**: choose the type of spam to configure.
- **Select a sanction**: choose the corresponding sanction.

#### Sanction types and triggers {#sanctions}

Here are the different **available sanctions** as well as the **triggers** that RaidProtect can detect, with the **default timeout duration** if applicable:

- **Warn**: Sends a warning to the member.
- **Kick**: Kicks the member from the server.
- **Timeout**: Mutes the member for a defined duration.
- **Softban**: Bans then immediately unbans the member, thereby deleting their messages.
- **Ban**: Permanently bans the member.
