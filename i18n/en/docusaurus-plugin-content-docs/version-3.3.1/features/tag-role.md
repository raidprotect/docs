title: Tag Role
---

The Tag Role automatically assigns a role to members who add [your server's tag](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/31444248479639-Server-Tags) to their Discord profile. By assigning a role to these members, you acknowledge their commitment and [encourage them to actively represent your server](https://dfr.gg/blog/2025/05/09/revolution-boosts-tags-serveur-publics#tags). It's a simple yet effective way to strengthen collective identity while rewarding your community's most loyal ambassadors.

## ❓ How the Tag Role Works {#working}

It's simple. As soon as a member adds the server's tag to their Discord profile, RaidProtect automatically assigns them a specific role.
If the member removes the tag, the role is removed.

:::info
If the Tag is not enabled or your server doesn't yet have the feature, the Tag Role will have no effect.

## 🎖️ Configuring the Tag Role {#config}

Configuration takes just a few clicks:
1. Use the [command `/settings`](../setup.md#settings).
2. Click the "**Tag Role**" button.
3. Select an existing role via the selector or click "**Create one for me**".
4. You can deselect the role at any time by clicking on the "**Reset**" button.

:::tip
Members will receive the role the next time they update their profile (Username, Avatar, Banner, Roles, Tag...). You can [contact support](https://raidprotect.bot/discord) to request a full role sync if you have many members who currently have or previously had the Tag.
